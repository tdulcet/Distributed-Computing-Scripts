END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

The full legal rules are at http://mersenne.org/legal/

It is up to you to get your employer's permission before installing this software
on any office machines.  Many companies have a strict policy against running any
non-business software, however hundreds of companies and other large organizations
are participating successfully in the GIMPS research project.  Your network
administrator, MIS or IT manager is welcome to contact us about this software at
primenet@mersenne.org.

Every effort has been made to ensure that you will be assigned an exponent that no
one else has tested or is testing.  We are not responsible for lost prize money,
fame, credit, etc. should someone accidentally or maliciously test the number you
are working on and find it to be prime.  We are not responsible should the program
determine a number composite even though it is prime - the program's heavy use of
memory and FPU could trigger an error that goes undetected. 

Finally, as with all freeware, the program is provided "as is".  However, please do
send bug reports and suggestions for improvements to woltman@alum.mit.edu. See
http://mersenne.org/freesoft/ for free updates.
